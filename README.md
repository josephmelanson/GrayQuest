## PREMISE
GrayQuest game is a text-based adventure game written in Java. GrayQuest is the latest (April 2021) iteration of a project intended as a learning tool that makes learning new programming languages, and their structures, more relatable to someone with interest in game design and mechanics.
The premise of GrayQuest is that one of the characters relatives has fallen ill, and the character must search all the biomes of the land to find the mythical "Glass Produce" needed to cure them. An elaboration of this premise will be featured in the game in version 1.0.
The rules that govern combat in GrayQuest are based on the Wizards of the Coast Dungeons & Dragons 5.1 Open Gaming License (https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd), but have been modified to create a simplier game experience and facilitate ease of coding.

## GAMEPLAY
Players are prompted to name or load a character. Characters begin in town, where they can choose from some town specific options or leave to the world map. Players can search on the world map, with a chance to find loot, monsters, or dungeons (bosses).

Players have the option to attack, flee, or use a potion on every combat round. If the play wins, there is a chance the defeated monster will drop an item. If the player has defeated enough monsters to level up, they will be notified of this and instructed to rest to town and rest to level up.

If a player defeats the bosses in each of the world dungeons (frozen north, tropical south, eastern mountains, western shores, central plains) they will be prompted to enter the Tower upon return to town, where they will face the final boss.
