# GrayQuest
GrayQuest game is a text-based adventure game written in Java. GrayQuest is the latest (April 2021) iteration of a project intended as a learning tool that makes learning new programming languages, and their structures, more relatable to someone with interest in game design and mechanics.

The rules that govern combat in GrayQuest are based on the Wizards of the Coast Dungeons & Dragons 5.1 Open Gaming License (https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd), but have been modified to create a simplier game experience and facilitate ease of coding.

## Version
This is version 0.9.

## Installation and Usage
A Java IDE is required to run GrayQuest. Run 'GrayQuest.java' and follow the onscreen prompts to start the game.

## Premise
The premise of GrayQuest is that one of the characters relatives has fallen ill, and the character must search all the biomes of the land to find the mythical "Glass Produce" needed to cure them. An elaboration of this premise will be featured in the game in version 1.0.

## Gameplay
Players are prompted to name or load a character. Characters begin in town, where they can chose from some town specific options or leave to the world map. Players can search on the world map, with a chance to find loot, monsters, or dungeons (bosses).

Players have the option to attack, flee, or use a potion on every combat round. If the play wins, there is a chance the defeated monster will an item potion. If the player has defeated enough monsters to level up, they will be notified of this and instructed to rest to town and rest to level up.

If a player defeates the bosses in each of the world dungeons (frozen north, tropical south, eastern mountains, western shores, central plains) they will be prompted to enter the Tower upon return to town, where they will face the final boss.

## Updates/Improvements
Version 1.0 will feature the implimentation of story text. Future versions may address changes to the character save/load system.

## Contributing
Feedback is very welcome. I'm primarly concerned with bugs and logical and syntaxual errors in the code.

## License
I need to learn more about licenses, and which one would be most appropriate for a project of this scope. Feedback welcomed.
